Our Intentions for "Lost in Space."

<!--more-->

The main purpose of this website is to host reproduction and helper materials (e.g, code, data, matrices) for scholars examining spatial interdependence in political science (and perhaps other disciplines.) At the same time we see this as a place where we, and hopefully others, will share things we have learned about conduction spatial analyses and anything else related to that topic.
