I am associate professor and department chair of political science at Arkansas State University with interests in comparative public administration, political economy, political methodology, and public policy. Starting in Fall 2022, I am also the founding director of the [Institute for Rural Initiatives](https://www.astate.edu/a/iri/). I am an affiliate faculty with the [Center for No Boundary Thinking](https://www.astate.edu/a/cnbt/) at A-State. I formerly served as the Research Director in the [MIT Election Data and Science Lab](http://electionlab.mit.edu), where I managed applied research on the scientific study of elections. I was previously an affiliate faculty member with the [Harvard Institute for Quantitative Social Science](https://www.iq.harvard.edu/home). I grew up on [Crowley's Ridge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crowley%27s_Ridge) in the Arkansas Delta.
